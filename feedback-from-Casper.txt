click and drag:
- mouse change to drag cursor
- timing point hover color change or outline
- when draggin, different color

(maybe visual metronome)

unclear that 4/4 is an input field - add i.e. pencil icon to side, or give a dark background like the buttons

Not pretty that numbers on timing points are outside the diamond
- maybe make diamond a bit larger, have the BPM in middle, and the number in top
- both numbers are inside the diamond
