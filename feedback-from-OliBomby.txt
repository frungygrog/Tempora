Easy to accidentally do BPM half or double the correct bpm

Definitely need to add dragging points to time

Need Ctrl+Z (good to do early)

BPM scrolling: smaller increments

(Open might be confused as mp3 open)

Can't drag to row below - fix

Rounding BPM to 3 decimal digits 
- makes it possible to use the osu editor to make a timing point with the same BPM
- no inconsistencies

Optimized red lines 
- placing timing points that don't change the BPM much can be simplified as 1 timing point

Sliders i.e. volume - should go where you click

maybe change private properties to lwoer case

Add namespaces to folders (Rider has an "Adjust Namespaces" feature)

Maybe make Todo milestones/issues in github

Rename WaveformWindow to WaveformRow

Addressing Rider warnings will already make it a lot better

AudioDataHandler - probably has more support for the stuff you did manually

Add summaries to FileHandler

c# events are easier to debug and follow than Godot signals 
- look into if it can be changed

Undo/Redo - each action is a command and an inverse should also be defined

There could be optimizations in terms of TimingPoints list
- can update in Timing.cs and make changes to each Timing Point whenever there's a change,
instead of using PreviousTimingPoint and NextTimingPoint
- data classes should not have references to other things, they should just have their own properties

could use json instead of tmpr

DrawLine - can probably batch it - check the _Draw docs for this

Again, Rider has tons of useful suggestions for your code
